Welcome to my personal academic website!  

I am **Hong Zhang**, a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Aerospace and Engineering at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**, China. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, **numerical algorithms**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)**. I specialize in developing efficient and scalable solvers for fluid flow problems, particularly leveraging **GPU acceleration** to achieve high performance.

My current work focuses on:
- ✨ High-order numerical methods (e.g., **WENO schemes**, **finite volume/difference methods**)
- ⚙️ GPU-accelerated solvers using **CUDA**, targeting **compressible flows** and **shock-capturing**
- 🧮 Data structures and parallel strategies for **structured and unstructured grids**
- 💻 Long-term goal: building a **modular, robust CFD framework** for both academic and engineering use
